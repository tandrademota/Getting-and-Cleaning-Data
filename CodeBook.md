In the final file "tidy_data.txt" I end up with four variables:
	1. subject - Numbers from 1 to 30 that correspond to people who are submitted to the test;
	2. activity - Six different types of activities of which the subjects could be submitted;
	3. variable - all features selected from original data set which represents mean or standard deviation of some measure;
	4. average - the mean value of features described by "variable"
